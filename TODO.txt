TODO LIST
---------

- Video AJax Upload
- FlowPlayer's subtitles (add subtitles to video nodes)
- Video image capture screen shots
- Thickbox support
- CCK support



- This will force browsers to save the file instead of playing it into browser's plugins.
<?php
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="filename.ext"');
?>

- video exported to Youtube
- similar to how image has "attach image node," it would be nice to have the "attach video node to another node type post" option.
- upload a video on a any content type (story or blog post)? Or just link, using something like [video=1]
- video image (when upload video ask users to select one image as thumbnail from few images created automatically)
